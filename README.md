# Path-Finding-Assignment
Implementation of 3 path finding algorithm( Best first, Dijkstra's and AStar ) for a university assignment.

# What I learned
* How to impliment C++ with .Net
* That sometimes starting from scratch is better than hammering down a road that is leading no where

# How I could improve
* C++ is not as nice to use with .Net as other languages( like VB or C# ), so if this was not assignment work I would have implimented it in C#
* I used a form window for simplicity but I could have used it in a game engine and shown a more graphical representation
